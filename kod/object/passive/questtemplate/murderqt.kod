      "Well, if you ask me, it seems like the Princess has quite "
      "a few armed troops.  Why is she mobilizing them unless she "
      "has something to hide?"
   murder_princess_w_2 = \
      "I honestly have no idea.  The duke was killed by a weapon "
      "and not magic, right?"
   murder_princess_w_3 = \
      "The murder of the Duke is a tragedy.  I think that no one is "
      "really above suspicion, even the fair Princess.  But, what kind "
      "of weapon would she use?"
   murder_princess_w_4 = \
      "I have heard that the Princess was trained in the arts of both "
      "weaponcraft and magic.  Although she hasn't used one in ages, I "
      "have also heard she is still an expert with the sword."
   murder_princess_w_5 = \
      "Oh, I doubt that the person that killed the Duke did the deed "
      "alone.  I am sure anyone, even the Princess, could have hired "
      "some shady character to murder in cold blood."
   murder_princess_m_1 = \
      "The Duke's death was obviously motivated by power.  There is no "
      "doubt that someone influential, like the Princess, wanted him out "
      "of the picture to increase her own power."
   murder_princess_m_2 = \
      "What other motive can there be but money?  With the shocking news "
      "of the death of the Duke, those in power could raid his holdings "
      "and gain some money.  Look at the faction troops roaming the lands.  "
      "They aren't cheap, you know."
   murder_princess_m_3 = \
      "It is unfortunate, but I'm sure that the driving force behind the "
      "Duke's unfortunate end is related to taxes.  Perhaps someone was "
      "tired of paying the high taxes, or perhaps another party wanted the "
      "tax money for themselves?"
   murder_princess_m_4 = \
      "People say that the intense feelings of dislike the Duke had for the "
      "poor Princess might have played a role in that dark night.  I doubt "

      "actions, I don't think the young Princess struck out at him."
   murder_princess_m_5 = \
      "The competition between the Duke and the Princess plays a large part "
      "in the murder plot, I fear.  The Princess might have rationalized "

      "when the time was right."
   murder_princess_c_1 = \
      "Well, I certainly think it is strange that the Meridian Council had "

   murder_princess_c_4 = \
      "Isn't it strange that the Duke was murdered so violently, but no one "
      "saw or heard anything?  Perhaps there was some strange magic "
      "at work that night."
   murder_princess_c_5 = \
      "I thought I heard a priestess say that there were strange magical "

   murder_jonas_c_1 = \

   murder_jonas_c_2 = \
      "Jonas claims he was in the Temple of Kraanan when the Duke was "

   murder_jonas_c_3 = \
      "I thought I heard that Jonas was blaming Rook for the murder.  Isn't "

   murder_jonas_c_4 = \

   murder_miriana_w_1 = \

   murder_miriana_w_2 = \
      "Somone said that Miriana once cut a spider in half with some strange "
      "magic.  The wound looked more like a weapon stroke than typical "
      "magical damage, they said."
   murder_miriana_w_3 = \
      "I overheard a conversation where one person told another that they "
      "heard Miriana running through the woods screaming something about "
      "Faren and wanting her weapon back.  What could that mean?"
   murder_miriana_w_4 = \

   murder_miriana_w_5 = \
      "I once heard that the living trees used to cast their lightning "
      "bolts at Miriana, and that she would cast them back at the trees "
      "at a greater strength.  Could she have used that power against "
      "the Duke?"
   murder_miriana_m_1 = \
      "I overheard a guard say that he went with a small band of guards "
      "into the forest looking for Miriana.  He said that when they found "

   murder_miriana_m_2 = \
      "A mage once told me that the Princess secretly supports Miriana "

   murder_miriana_m_3 = \
      "I remember a story about how the Duke told a joke about how "
      "Miriana kept animal friends because they were the only ones that "
      "could stand her.  After that, there was a loud stroke of thunder "

      "Duke, and warned him of some danger.  After the event she predicted "

   murder_miriana_c_1 = \

   murder_miriana_c_5 = \
      "I've heard people claim that Miriana is behind the murder of the "

   murder_lich_c_1 =\
      "Well, I heard that one of the innkeepers was delivering some ale to "
      "the Duke's castle, to get ready for the big banquet.  Apparently there "
      "was a curious woman hanging around the delivery carts when they were "
      "going in.  He said she had very pale skin and was wearing a strange "

   murder_lich_c_2 = \
      "I heard from a travelling merchant that there were all sorts of "

   murder_lich_c_3 = \
      "I've heard people suggest that the Lich Queen might have killed the "
      "Duke, but if you think about it, the Duke hadn't really done much to "

      "wanted him to, it might be a different story."
   murder_lich_c_4 =\
      "Well, I'm sure I don't know anything about that.  I was visiting my "
      "mother; she's not well you know.  But if you think about it, it seems "
      "like the necromancers have been awfully quiet lately, maybe too quiet."
   murder_lich_c_5 = \
      "Well, I can't be certain mind you, but I did hear that a large group "
      "of necromancers had been seen coming up through the mountains towards "
      "Tos about a week before the murder."
   murder_lich_w_1 =\
      "I don't know if I should tell you this or not, but a friend of mine "
      "works as a guard for the Duke and he says that there is a big cover up "
      "going on.  Seems the Duke wasn't murdered at all!  He killed himself "

   murder_lich_w_2 =\
      "I don't know anything about a weapon, but I do know that the feast "
      "hall was locked, no way in or out.  So whoever killed him must have "
      "had some way of teleporting out of there.  The only people I know of "
      "with magic like that are the necromancers."
   murder_lich_w_3 =\

      "I've heard that one of the Duke's guards saw someone who looked "
      "exactly like the Duke walking out of the castle after the Duke had "
      "died.  He ran up to investigate, but whoever it was just disappeared, "
      "leaving only a puddle of slimy goo."
   murder_lich_m_1 =\
      "I've heard that the Duke was having the banquet to announce a big "
      "offensive against Brax to wipe out the Lich Queen and her "

   murder_lich_m_2 =\
      "Hmmm... well it's certainly no secret that the necromancers and Queen "
      "Venya'cyr would stop at nothing to disrupt and weaken us."
   murder_lich_m_3 =\
      "Well, the old Duke did just fine holding his own until Queen Venya'cyr "
      "reared her ugly head.  So if you ask me she's probably responsible."
   murder_lich_m_4 =\
      "Some people say that it must have been the lich queen who killed the "
      "Duke, but we all know that she hasn't left Brax in millennia."
   murder_lich_m_5 =\
      "Didn't Queen Venya'cyr vow to kill both the Duke and the Princess?  "
      "Kateriina should look out, she could be next!"
   murder_akardius_c_1=\
      "Well, don't tell Duke Akardius I said this, but its hard to think of "
      "anyone else who had access to the feast hall, now isn't it?"
   murder_akardius_c_2=\
      "All I know is that the new Duke moved pretty fast after his uncle "

   murder_akardius_c_3=\
      "Anyone who saw the look on that poor boy's face when he saw his "

   murder_akardius_c_4=\
      "They say that the Duke was holding the banquet in honor of his "
      "Nephew.  It was to be his big welcome back to the mainland, and the "
      "Duke was going to name him as his heir."
   murder_akardius_c_5=\
      "There is more to Duke Akardius then meets the eye;  ever wonder where "
      "he's been all these years?  The Island, studying at the Temple of "
      "Riija, that's where!  I tell you, anyone who has spent that much time "
      "with the God of Trickery isn't to be trusted."
   murder_akardius_w_1=\
      "From what I've heard the Duke wasn't killed with a weapon or by "
      "magic.  It was poison.  Isn't poison the way the royals have always "

   murder_akardius_w_2=\
      "They say that the day after the Duke was killed Akardius got a new "
      "sword from the armory.  I wonder why he didn't want to carry his old "
      "one anymore..."
   murder_akardius_w_3=\
      "I've heard that Duke Akardius studied at the Temple of Riija while he "
      "was away.  I wonder if they teach more than simple illusions to "
      "advanced students.  After all, Riija is the trickster god and some "
      "tricks can be deadly."
   murder_akardius_w_4=\
      "I know they checked all the guards' weapons as soon as the Duke was "
      "killed, and I've heard that Duke Akardius volunteered to go first to "
      "set an example for his men."
   murder_akardius_w_5=\
      "They say that Duke Akardius was an accomplished swordsman.  Not that "
      "he'd have to be all that tough to get the jump on his uncle.  I mean "
      "after all he was a bit, um... big boned."
   murder_akardius_m_1=\
      "You know what they say: look toward the one who prospered the most."
   murder_akardius_m_2=\
      "I've heard that Duke Akardius didn't want to go to the Island, but that "
      "his uncle sent him away when he was young.  Maybe he hated his uncle "
      "for that."
   murder_akardius_m_3=\
      "I heard that the Duke had been praising Jonas's military skill and "

   murder_akardius_m_4=\
      "Madelia told me that she went on a picnic with Akardius and that "
      "afterward he got very upset and ran off, crying, \"Oh how could I have "
      "done this to poor Princess Kateriina?\"  Could they be in love?  "
      "The Old Duke certainly wouldn't have approved of that!"
   murder_akardius_m_5=\
      "Everyone knows that the Duke was planning on making Akardius his heir "
      "anyway.  I don't see why he would have wanted to harm the uncle who "

   murder_maleval_c_1 =\
      "hmm... well the first thing that comes to mind is that Maleval "

   murder_maleval_c_2 =\

   murder_maleval_c_4 =\
      "One of the Duke's caterers told me that Kalior was holding the feast "

   murder_maleval_w_3 =\
      "Well I certainly wouldn't know, although I would think you'd need "
      "pretty powerful magic for a job like that."
   murder_maleval_w_4 =\
      "I have it from a very authoritative source that Kalior was beaten to "
      "death, but I don't believe it for a second.  I'm certain Maleval did "

   murder_maleval_m_3 =\
      "Well, despite what some might say, I think we can rule out Maleval.  "
